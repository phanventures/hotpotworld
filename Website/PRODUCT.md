# Hot Pot World Rotary — product context

Inferred from the existing site, its copy, and the restaurant's own materials,
not from an interview. Anything marked **assumption** is worth confirming with
the restaurant before it drives a decision.

## What it is

An all you can eat hot pot and Korean BBQ restaurant at 2020 S 320th St,
Suite G, Federal Way, WA 98003. Open daily, 11:00 AM to 10:00 PM.
(206) 429-3770. One flat price: **$39.99 per person**.

## The differentiator

A conveyor belt runs around the dining room stacked with fresh plates under
clear lids. You take what you want as it passes, and every seat has its own pot
and its own burner. The site's own copy says it was the first of its kind in
the Seattle area.

Two things follow from this, and they drive the whole design:

1. **The belt is the entire reason to choose this place over any other hot pot
   restaurant.** It must be visible in the first viewport, not described in
   paragraph four.
2. **Hot pot is intimidating to people who have never eaten it.** A meaningful
   share of visitors need to be told the thing is easy before they will book a
   table. That is why "How It Works" is a top-level page and not an FAQ.

## Who it is for

**Assumption**, drawn from the photography and the bilingual menu naming:

- Groups and families in South King County deciding where to eat tonight. The
  room photographs show large multi-generational tables, so the site should not
  read as a date-night restaurant.
- Vietnamese and wider Asian-American diners for whom the Vietnamese menu names
  are the signal that this is the real thing.
- First-timers who have heard of hot pot and have never done it.
- People bringing out-of-town guests somewhere memorable.

## What a win looks like

In order:

1. The visitor gets in a car. Directions, hours and phone are the conversion.
2. The visitor understands the format well enough not to be put off.
3. The visitor orders delivery through Uber Eats.

The site is not a booking system and there is no reservation flow. Phone is how
large parties are handled.

## Breadth beyond hot pot

The kitchen also makes banh mi, pho, pad thai, fried rice and teriyaki to
order. This matters because it answers the objection "not everyone in my group
wants to cook their own dinner."

## Broths

Eight, deliberately from different countries rather than one tradition: Pork,
Chicken and Beef as house pots; Fermented Fish (Vietnam), Tom Yum (Thailand),
Sichuan (China), Kim Chi (Korea); and an all-vegetable pot.

Because the diner picks every ingredient themselves, hot pot is unusually easy
to eat around an allergy or a dietary restriction, and the site says so.

## Recognition

Restaurant Guru 2023, recommended restaurant in Federal Way. A Seattle Times
mention in a roundup of notable new restaurant openings. **The Seattle Times
mention has no link**; if the article URL exists it should be linked.

## Constraints that are not negotiable

- **Static HTML, CSS and one small JS file.** No build step, no framework, no
  CMS. Open the file in a browser and it works.
- **No external requests on page load.** No CDN, no web fonts over the wire, no
  analytics, no map iframe, nothing from youtube.com until a visitor presses
  play. This is a deliberate privacy and speed decision and it survived the
  redesign.
- All photography is the restaurant's own or supplied by the owner.

## Open questions for the restaurant

1. The broth list comes from the January 2024 printed menu and may have changed
   under the new all you can eat service.
2. Whether BBQ carries a different price for kids or large parties.
3. Whether the guest quotes on the site can be attributed to named reviewers.
   They currently run unattributed, which is the weakest form of social proof.
4. Whether smoothies, beer and wine are still served. The old printed menu had
   all three; the current site does not mention them.
